Hello everyone! I'm the developer of the ayakaOS blog and the official ayakaOS website. This blog is built based on the open-source repository by the great YYsuni (https://github.com/YYsuni/2025-blog-public) – a huge thank you for the amazing open-source work!
 
My mind’s gone a blank trying to think of what to write, I’m just really happy to have you all read this post. Don’t worry, I’ll be sure to chase the team on the progress of the system development!
 
I’ll be the main updater for this blog from now on – the other team members are all pretty lazy, hehe. We’ll post our random thoughts here from time to time, and also release ayakaOS-related tutorials in batches. This will be our exclusive hub for all tutorials!
 
Do drop by often! That’s all for now, bye~
